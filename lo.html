            I made a repository in GitHub and I started coding in Visual Studio Cude. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the website. I used GitHub to keep track of my code and to make sure I didn't lose it. I also used GitHub to share my code with others.

           The ReadMe file is part of learning outcome 2 because it helps others understand my project and how to use it. It is interactive because it gives an overview of the project and helps others understand what it is about. This will help us create a more focused and effective project that meets the needs of the users we are working with.

        <p>
            I learned that a ReadMe file is important to give an overview of the project and help others understand what it is about. I also learned that it is important to communicate with your group and get feedback on your work. This will help us in the next steps because we can use this feedback to make changes in our project before we start coding it.

        </h3>
        <p>
            I searched some fun and easy logo designs on Pinterest to get some inspiration for what I wanted. When I got some inspiration I went into Adobe Illustrator and created some logos.<br>
            <img src="/Media/logov1.png" alt="logodesign" style="width: 80%;"><br>
            On our second presentation of our studio we didn't use the logo yet but the coaches said they really liked the picture we had in the beginning of our presentation as logo, so I scrapped everything I made and started again with Illustrator to make new logos like that one.<br>

        <p>
            We had to make a poster that when people walk past it they immediately see what we are going to make. First I didn't really know how to do that so I put a lot of text on a file in Adobe Illustrator. I asked feedback on it. <br>
            The feedback was that it wasn't visual enough and far too much text. We went to the location of our so maybe I could use pictures I made of the location to make it more visual. and I had to make a visual design of the idea we had.<br>
            I thought this was a good Idea since I didn't really know how to make a good poster for it. I summarized the text more but kept the most important parts. I wanted to make it more Dutch looking because it would be a Ditch app, and I added the phone to make it more visual.        
        </p>
        <img src="/Media/Poster IMA 2.1.png" alt="Moodboard DCODE" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>
            I made a new poster design keeping the feedback I got in mind to make it more visual. I still wanted to make the poster Dutch because it was going to be a Dutch learning app we were going to make. After I made this poster in Figma I asked feedback again.<br>
            The feedback was that the pictures I put in the poster weren't relevant to what we were making so I didn't have to put them in. The phone I had should be bigger because that's the main thing from our project. An app on the phone. The languages I put in could also be more visual with flags of the countries. And I had to put in way less text.<br>
            I found this feedback more useful then the previous feedback. I made the flags visual and I made the phone bigger because that's the central part of our project. I added a lay-out on the phone of how our app was going to look like so people had an idea about that. I put the 4 most important things about the app on the side so people don't have to ask about that, and I added all the text in a QR-code if you want to find out more about the app. I made it more colorful instead of black because that makes it more fun to look at and I kept the tulips in the background to make it more Dutch.
        </p>
        <img src="/Media/Poster IMA projects 3.2.png" alt="Moodboard DCODE" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>
            I again made a new poster. The final one. I deleted the pictures because I agreed that it wasn't relevant for an information poster about our app. The phone is in the central so it's clear that it'll be an app for on the phone. There were flags instead of the languages and I made clear you can learn Dutch from a lot of languages. I put the text we wanted to put on the poster in a QR-code so if people are interested they can scan it and read it themselves. I still kept the Dutch style by using tulips in the poster.

           The results are the poster you see above. I am really proud of it. I think it looks really good and it fits what we are trying to make. I didn't know how to make a good concept poster for our project that's why I started with the first one. but since I got more feedback it was way more clear for me and that's why I deleted some things and added other.

            Together we decided we wanted to make a logo with a sorth of animal, kind of like Duolingo has. A mascot type. We wanted something Dutch so someone in our group came up with a Cow. I thought this was a good idea since a cow is a typical Dutch animal. I made a logo design of a cow in Adobe Illustrator. I got the inspiration from DuoLingo, just a zoomed in head of a orange cow. I thought that would be pretty cool.

            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We used Trello to keep track of our tasks and what we had to do.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We did this because we wanted to keep track of our tasks and what we had to do. I put in the things I wanted to do and put a deadline for it so I know when I want to finish it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did we do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We made a Trello board and we put all our tasks on it. We also put the deadlines on it and we put the people who had to do it on it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The results are that we kept track of our tasks and what we had to do. We also kept track of the deadlines and who had to do it. To be honest we only did this for creating the studio because we kept postponing our deadlines since we didn't finish our work on time. As a group we prefer to communicate about stuff and not look at a deadline because this can give stress and we prefer to work in this way.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned that it's important to keep track of your tasks and what you have to do. I also learned that it's important to keep track of the deadlines and who has to do it. Even though Trello doesn't work for me, it's nice to put in what you still have to do. This will help me in the next steps because I now know how to keep track of my tasks and what I have to do.

            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We visited the location of our project and we did interviews with the refugees and volunteers that were there.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to know what the refugees need more to learn Dutch and to learn about the Dutch culture. We also wanted to know what the volunteers do and how they work. And we wanted to look at the location to get a better insight of the location and the refugees.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did we do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We prepared an interview to do with both of them. I voice recorded it (with permission of course) so we can listen it back in case we missed something.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We had an interview with a person who didn't speak Dutch or English so it was pretty hard to communicate with them. I thought all of them would at least talk a little bit of English. Making a Dutch learning app now is much harder because we have to translate everything from their motherlanguage so every refugee can use the app. For English speaking people it's not that hard to make because we can speak English of course and we can communicate in English as well. But we want to include every refugee so we have to translate it from every language who is there at IMA.
            I think this is good we found this out early on in the project so we can work on it and find a solution for it. We also found out that the refugees really want to learn Dutch and they are really motivated to learn it. They also want to learn about the Dutch culture and how to live in the Netherlands. This is really good because we can use this for our project and we can make an app that helps them with this.

            What did I do?

        <p>
            I did research for app ideas we had for the refugees.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to find out what app we were really going to use. I took 5 ideas off the brainstorming board and went looking online if there were any apps that were similar to the ideas we had. I looked at the reviews and what people liked and disliked about the app. I also looked at the design of the app and how it worked.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I looked on Google and in the app store for apps that were similar to the ideas we had. I looked at the reviews and what people liked and disliked about the app. I also looked at the design of the app and how it worked.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The results were that all the apps I researched kinda looked like each other. They mostly translate from English to a lot of languages which makes it hard for non-English speakers to learn another language. We want to change this in our app.
           </p>

            I learned that it's important to do research for your project. This gives you a better insight of what is already out there and what you can do to make it better.

            Stakeholder contact
        </h4>
        <p>
            We had contact with our stakeholder multiple times. The first time we did an interview to find out what she thought of our project ideas. I recorded it with her permission. I listened it back afterwards and wrote the most important things down. The second time we had contact with her we were on location. She gave us some tips on who we could interview which we did. I also recorded these conversations to listen them back and write the most important things down. And now every week we sent her our work and what we are doing now. I help my group with what we have to put in the mail, but I don;t send it because we have one person who always sent the mails.<br> For the rest she gave us some ideas which we can implement in the app like scanning QR-codes on for example a house, and if you scan it you can get the dutch translation of house. I thought this was a really good idea, only we don't want to put QR-codes around the location but I decided to make sort of a memory game out of it to make it more fun.

        </h4>
        <p>
            The reason I didn’t go to the art festival is because I had to pick up my sister from the hospital in Sittard because she got surgery and my parents couldn’t pick her up. And besides that, I prefer the development side and  “The art department” doesn’t really sound like development.

        <p>
            What I want to be in the future is probably a developer. But I found out I also liked creating posters and stuff, asking feedback on it and implementing the feedback on the poster to make it perfect. I normally didn’t really like creating stuff like that but making the poster for our project was really fun. So probably something between these two things.<br>
            For my school career I really want to get better in JavaScript and understand everything I do. When I work with JavaScript I always find it impressive how it works and how you can make everything with it.

        <p>
            I think one of my strenghts is that I am a good team player. I like to help my group where I can and give them feedback. I show everything I make to my group and ask them for feedback to make our project even better.
            <br>What I think I might need to improve is my lack of concentration. I sometimes get distracted very easily and forget to do my work and the deadline we have for it. I think I need to work on that and make sure I stay focused on my work and the deadlines we have so we finish everything on time.

            I don't really show leadership in my group. normally we decide what we still have to do and I choose one of the topics we still have to do and work on it by myself and show it after. This is a point I can and will also work on.

            I went to the career day and I thought it was really interesting. I learned a lot about different companies and what they do. I think it is really interesting what you can do after the study. I also looked at different professions I can do and I found front end development the most interesting. My preference was already front end or design but I went to both of them and I choose front end because this caught my attention more.<br> I think career days are good to see what you want to do in the future and of course for internship.

            We had a showcase for our project. I thought it was really fun to show our project to other students and coaches and we got a lot of good feedback on our project which we can use to improve our project. I also went to different projects and gave them feedback. I thought it was really interesting to see what other students made and how they did it. I think this is a good way to learn from each other and to get feedback on your project. I also learned a lot from the other projects and I think this will help me in the future.
