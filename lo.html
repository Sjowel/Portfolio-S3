            How did it go and do you notice any difficulties and challenges?
        </h3>
        <p>
            It actually happened quite naturally. My group and I just made everything individually. Looked at all the designs and took the best parts of them and put them together in a final design.

        <p>
            I made a moodboard for our studio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made this moodboard to find out what kind of style we wanted to choose for our studio. I wanted it to be more like a calm, relaxing and professional style.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I looked for pictures on Pinterest and Google that I thought would fit the style I wanted. I looked for pictures that were calm and relaxing. I also looked for pictures that were professional and clean.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We had 5 different moodboards since there are 5 people in our group. We all made a moodboard in our preferred style. We looked at all the moodboards and choose the syle we liked the most and made another moodboard out of this.

        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We did this because we wanted it to be one style and to be clear for everyone what the style was.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I looked at the previous moodboards to take inspiration from them. We wanted our moodboard to be more of a tech style because we are a development studio. After I did this I went on Pinterest to see if I could find more pictures in this style and I added the best ones on the moodboard.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The final moodboard we have now. It's in our style how we want our studio to be and how we like it.

            We did this because we wanted to have a font that fits our style and moodboard.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I scrolled through the fonts in Figma to find fonts that looked good and fit the style of tech/development. I looked for fonts that were clean and professional. I also looked for fonts that were easy to read and not too fancy. Everyone in the group did this and after we all voted on the best font.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           After we voted on the font we liked best, we all agreed that was going to be the font of our studio. It's a clear and professioan font so we didn't really need a second font.

        <p>
            We couldn't figure out what word we wanted to use: Create, Develop or Design. So we thought why not use them all three.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I looked up on YouTube how Adobe After Effects worked and how to make a text animation. I looke at a few videos and then I tried to do it myself. It went pretty good. Then Louis told me to color the three words into the colors of our logo. So I found out myself how to do that and I did.

            on our second presentation of our studio we didn't use the logo yet but the coaches said they really liked the picture we had in the beginning of our presentation as logo, so I scrapped everything I made and started again with Illustrator to make new logos like that one.

            How did it go and do you notice any difficulties and challenges?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think it went well. I like to work in a team and I like to help people. I also like to give my opinion about things and I like to hear the opinion of others. I think I am a good team player and I can work well with others.

            Playground Festival "The art department"
        </h4>
        <p>
            The reason I didn’t go to the art festival is because I had to pick up my sister from the hospital in Sittard because she got surgery and my parents couldn’t pick her up. And besides that, I prefer the development side and  “The art department” doesn’t really sound like development.

            Future
        </h4>
        <p>
            What I want to be in the future is probably a developer. But I found out I also liked creating posters and stuff, asking feedback on it and implementing the feedback on the poster to make it perfect. I normally didn’t really like creating stuff like that but making the poster for our project was really fun. So probably something between these two things.
