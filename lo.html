        <p>
            It actually happened quite naturally. My group and I just made everything individually. Looked at all the designs and took the best parts of them and put them together in a final design.

            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made a moodboard for our studio to choose what type of style we wanted to use. It's a collection of pictures that represent the style I wanted to use for our studio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made this moodboard to find out what kind of style we wanted to choose for our studio. I wanted it to be more like a calm, relaxing and professional style. <br>
            Creating a moodboard is an important step in the process of designing an interactive media product, because it helps collect and analyze visual inspiration. My group and I wanted to make an website for our studio so I made a visual design of how I wanted it to look like. This interactive discussion and decision-making process is similar to user-centered design: you discuss, respond, and adapt. I searched for images that were calm, relaxing, and had a clean, professional look.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To create the moodboard I wanted, I started by thinking about the style I wanted it to be and the feeling it gives you. I choose for calm, relaxing and professional. When I decided about the style I searched images on Pinterest and Google that matched this idea. I focused on soft colors, minimalistic designs and clean layouts. I looked for pictures that gave me a peaceful and calm feeling and used it for my moodboard. I added the pictures that for me gave that feeling and added it to my moodboard to create a clear visual direction.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We had 5 different moodboards since there are 5 people in our group. We all made a moodboard in our preferred style. We looked at all the moodboards and choose the syle we liked the most and made another moodboard out of this.<br><br> 
            Making the moodboard is part of learning outcome 1 because it helps with the first step of designing an interactive media product. The moodboard was interactive because we worked together as a group, looked at each other’s moodboards, and gave feedback to choose one style. We also used digital tools to find and show our visual ideas. The style we chose will be used later in the design of an interactive product like a website or app, where users will see a calm and professional look.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned that creating a moodboard is a great way to start the design process. It helps to visualize ideas and gives a clear direction for the design. I also learned that working together as a group and giving feedback is important to create a final product that everyone is happy with. This will help us in the next steps of the project because we now have a clear style to follow when designing our studio.

            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Together as a group, we created the final moodboard for our studio. This moodboard represents the visual identity and overall style we all agreed on after comparing our individual ideas and preferences.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We made this final moodboard to make sure we all had the same vision for the studio’s look and feel. By combining the best elements from each of our individual moodboards, we created one clear and consistent style. This helps guide our future design decisions and keeps everyone on the same page.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To help create the final moodboard, I first looked back at all the individual moodboards we made earlier. I used these to get inspiration and understand which elements worked well. Since we are a development studio, we wanted the final moodboard to reflect a more tech-focused style—modern, clean, and innovative. After that, I searched for new images on Pinterest that matched this tech aesthetic. I focused on visuals that had a modern and digital look, and selected the ones that best represented the feeling we were going for. I added these to the moodboard to help shape the final version.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The result is our final group moodboard. It clearly shows the style we want for our studio: modern, tech-inspired, and professional. It reflects who we are as a team and sets the tone for how our website and other visual designs will look like, and that we are more focused on the development part of media design.<br><br>
            The final moodboard is part of learning outcome 1 because it shows how we conceptualized and designed our studio’s identity. It is interactive because we all contributed to it, shared our ideas, and worked together to create a cohesive design. The moodboard will guide us in the next steps of designing our website and other media products, ensuring that we maintain a consistent style throughout our work.
        </p>

            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned that collaboration is key when creating a cohesive design. By combining our individual ideas, we were able to create a stronger final product. This experience taught me the importance of communication and feedback in the design process. In the next steps, this will help us stay aligned and focused on our shared vision as we move forward with the project.

        <h3>
            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We researched a variety of fonts to find out which one would fit the style of the moodboard we made. Our goal was to choose a font that would fit with the calm, professional and tech-inspired style we created for our studio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We chose to look at different fonts because the typography is a very important role in setting a tone and feeling of our studio's identity. We really wanted a font that would fit our easthetic we created in our moodboard. A good font can strengthen the overall design.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I scrolled through the fonts in Figma to find fonts that looked good and fit the style of tech/development. I looked for fonts that were clean and professional. I also looked for fonts that were easy to read and not too fancy. Everyone in the group did this and after we all voted on the best font.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           After we voted on the font we liked best, we all agreed that was going to be the font of our studio. It's a clear and professioan font so we didn't really need a second font.<br>
           Font research is part of learning outcome 1 because it is an important step in the design process. It helps us choose a font that fits our studio's identity and the style we want to achieve. The process was interactive because we all contributed our ideas and preferences, and worked together to find a font that everyone liked. This will help us maintain a consistent look and feel in our designs, making sure everything aligns with our studio's vision.

            I turned our slogan into a small animation to tell more about our studio. I made it so it works good with our style.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Me and my group had trouble choosing between the words "Create," "develop," and "Design" for our slogan, because each one represents a very important part of what we do. So insead of choosing just one, I made a small and subtle animation with all three words. This way, the animation highlights the full range of our work while keeping the message dynamic and engaging.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I started by watching a few youTube tutorials on how to learn the basics of Adobe After Effects since I had no clue how to use that. I wanted to learn simple text animations. After getting a general idea, I experimented with the tools myself and managed to animate the slogan. Later, Louis suggested that I could add our colors to the three words to mach our logo. I figured out how to apply this to only the switching words and updated the animation.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The result is the animated video on top of this text. It brings our slogan to life in a way that matches the overall style of the project. I am proud of how it turned out, especially since it was my first time working with Adobe After Effects.
           the slogan is part of learning outcome 1 because it is an important part of our studio's identity. It helps us communicate what we do and what we stand for. The animation is interactive because it adds a dynamic element to our design, making it more engaging for the audience. This will help us create a strong visual identity for our studio and make our work more memorable.

            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?

        <p>
           I learned the basics of Adobe After Effects, including how to animate text and apply custom colors or a gradient. The experience gave me more confidence in using animation tools. In further steps I will be able to create more advanced animation to make our designs more dynamic and engaging.

            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made a design for the app we are going to make for our project. I made a level pad for the app so the users can see how far they are in the app and how many levels they have to go.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to help the users see how far they are in the app and how many levels they have to go. I thought it would be a good idea to make a level pad so the users can see their progress in the app. This way they can see how much they have learned and how far they are in the app.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Someone of our group made the icons for the levels and I made the path in between it to make it more visual and to show that all the levels are connected. I made the level path in Figma and used the icons that were made by someone else in our group. I used the colors from our branding to make it fit our style. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A clean pathway through the levels that shows the users how far they are in the app. I think it looks good and fits our style.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>
            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned how to make a level pad in Figma and how to use the colors from our branding. I also learned how to work together with someone else in the group to create a design that fits our style. This will help us in the next steps because we can use this level pad in our app and it will help the users see their progress in the app.

        </h4>
        <h3>
            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did user testing with our prototype of the app in Figma. I made a usertest and tested it with our target audience to see if they like it and if they have any feedback on our app before we start coding it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to see if our app is user friendly and if the users like it. It is important to test your app before you start coding it so you can make changes if needed. This way you can make sure that the users are happy with the app and that it is easy to use.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p> 
            I made a user test in Word looked for people that are the target audience for our app and did the usertest with them. I asked questions about the app to find out more about it, I looked if they went through the app easily and if i saw any problems.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I got some minor feedback and wrote it down. I talked with my group about it and looked if I could change some things in the prototype based on the feedback the target audience gave me.

        </p>
        <h3>
            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned that it is important to test your app before you start coding it to change things if needed. I also learned that it is important to get feedback from the target audience to see if they like the app and if it is user friendly. This will help us in the next steps because we can use this feedback to make changes in our app before we start coding it.

        <p>
            I searched some fun and easy logo designs on Pinterest to get some inspiration for what I wanted. When I got some inspiration I went into Adobe Illustrator and created some logos.<br>
            <img src="/Media/logov1.png" alt="logodesign" style="width: 80%;"><br>
            On our second presentation of our studio we didn't use the logo yet but the coaches said they really liked the picture we had in the beginning of our presentation as logo, so I scrapped everything I made and started again with Illustrator to make new logos like that one.<br>

        <img src="/Media/IMA projects poster 1.png" alt="Moodboard DCODE" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>
            We had to make a poster that when people walk past it they immediately see what we are going to make. First I didn't really know how to do that so I put a lot of text on a file in Adobe Illustrator. I asked feedback on it. <br>
            The feedback was that it wasn't visual enough and far too much text. We went to the location of our so maybe I could use pictures I made of the location to make it more visual. and I had to make a visual design of the idea we had.<br>
            I thought this was a good Idea since I didn't really know how to make a good poster for it. I summarized the text more but kept the most important parts. I wanted to make it more Dutch looking because it would be a Ditch app, and I added the phone to make it more visual.        
        </p>
        <img src="/Media/Poster IMA 2.1.png" alt="Moodboard DCODE" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>
            I made a new poster design keeping the feedback I got in mind to make it more visual. I still wanted to make the poster Dutch because it was going to be a Dutch learning app we were going to make. After I made this poster in Figma I asked feedback again.<br>
            The feedback was that the pictures I put in the poster weren't relevant to what we were making so I didn't have to put them in. The phone I had should be bigger because that's the main thing from our project. An app on the phone. The languages I put in could also be more visual with flags of the countries. And I had to put in way less text.<br>
            I found this feedback more useful then the previous feedback. I made the flags visual and I made the phone bigger because that's the central part of our project. I added a lay-out on the phone of how our app was going to look like so people had an idea about that. I put the 4 most important things about the app on the side so people don't have to ask about that, and I added all the text in a QR-code if you want to find out more about the app. I made it more colorful instead of black because that makes it more fun to look at and I kept the tulips in the background to make it more Dutch.
        </p>
        <img src="/Media/Poster IMA projects 3.2.png" alt="Moodboard DCODE" style="width: 50%;">
        <p>
            I again made a new poster. The final one. I deleted the pictures because I agreed that it wasn't relevant for an information poster about our app. The phone is in the central so it's clear that it'll be an app for on the phone. There were flags instead of the languages and I made clear you can learn Dutch from a lot of languages. I put the text we wanted to put on the poster in a QR-code so if people are interested they can scan it and read it themselves. I still kept the Dutch style by using tulips in the poster.

I didn't know how to make a good concept poster for our project that's why I started with the first one. but since I got more feedback it was way more clear for me and that's why I deleted some things and added other.

            Together we decided we wanted to make a logo with a sorth of animal, kind of like Duolingo has. A mascot type. We wanted something Dutch so someone in our group came up with a Cow. I thought this was a good idea since a cow is a typical Dutch animal. I made a logo design of a cow in Adobe Illustrator. I got the inspiration from DuoLingo, just a zoomed in head of a orange cow. I thought that would be pretty cool.

            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We used Trello to keep track of our tasks and what we had to do.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We did this because we wanted to keep track of our tasks and what we had to do. I put in the things I wanted to do and put a deadline for it so I know when I want to finish it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did we do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We made a Trello board and we put all our tasks on it. We also put the deadlines on it and we put the people who had to do it on it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The results are that we kept track of our tasks and what we had to do. We also kept track of the deadlines and who had to do it. To be honest we only did this for creating the studio because we kept postponing our deadlines since we didn't finish our work on time. As a group we prefer to communicate about stuff and not look at a deadline because this can give stress and we prefer to work in this way.
        </p>

            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?

        <p>
            I learned that it's important to keep track of your tasks and what you have to do. I also learned that it's important to keep track of the deadlines and who has to do it. Even though Trello doesn't work for me, it's nice to put in what you still have to do. This will help me in the next steps because I now know how to keep track of my tasks and what I have to do.

            What did we do?

        <p>
            We visited the location of our project and we did interviews with the refugees and volunteers that were there.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to know what the refugees need more to learn Dutch and to learn about the Dutch culture. We also wanted to know what the volunteers do and how they work. And we wanted to look at the location to get a better insight of the location and the refugees.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did we do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We prepared an interview to do with both of them. I voice recorded it (with permission of course) so we can listen it back in case we missed something.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We had an interview with a person who didn't speak Dutch or English so it was pretty hard to communicate with them. I thought all of them would at least talk a little bit of English. Making a Dutch learning app now is much harder because we have to translate everything from their motherlanguage so every refugee can use the app. For English speaking people it's not that hard to make because we can speak English of course and we can communicate in English as well. But we want to include every refugee so we have to translate it from every language who is there at IMA.
            I think this is good we found this out early on in the project so we can work on it and find a solution for it. We also found out that the refugees really want to learn Dutch and they are really motivated to learn it. They also want to learn about the Dutch culture and how to live in the Netherlands. This is really good because we can use this for our project and we can make an app that helps them with this.

            I did research for app ideas we had for the refugees.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to find out what app we were really going to use. I took 5 ideas off the brainstorming board and went looking online if there were any apps that were similar to the ideas we had. I looked at the reviews and what people liked and disliked about the app. I also looked at the design of the app and how it worked.

        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The results were that all the apps I researched kinda looked like each other. They mostly translate from English to a lot of languages which makes it hard for non-English speakers to learn another language. We want to change this in our app.

            Stakeholder contact
        </h4>
        <p>
            We had contact with our stakeholder multiple times. The first time we did an interview to find out what she thought of our project ideas. I recorded it with her permission. I listened it back afterwards and wrote the most important things down. The second time we had contact with her we were on location. She gave us some tips on who we could interview which we did. I also recorded these conversations to listen them back and write the most important things down. And now every week we sent her our work and what we are doing now. I help my group with what we have to put in the mail, but I don;t send it because we have one person who always sent the mails.<br> For the rest she gave us some ideas which we can implement in the app like scanning QR-codes on for example a house, and if you scan it you can get the dutch translation of house. I thought this was a really good idea, only we don't want to put QR-codes around the location but I decided to make sort of a memory game out of it to make it more fun.

            The reason I didn’t go to the art festival is because I had to pick up my sister from the hospital in Sittard because she got surgery and my parents couldn’t pick her up. And besides that, I prefer the development side and  “The art department” doesn’t really sound like development.

            What I want to be in the future is probably a developer. But I found out I also liked creating posters and stuff, asking feedback on it and implementing the feedback on the poster to make it perfect. I normally didn’t really like creating stuff like that but making the poster for our project was really fun. So probably something between these two things.<br>
            For my school career I really want to get better in JavaScript and understand everything I do. When I work with JavaScript I always find it impressive how it works and how you can make everything with it.

            I think one of my strenghts is that I am a good team player. I like to help my group where I can and give them feedback. I show everything I make to my group and ask them for feedback to make our project even better.
            <br>What I think I might need to improve is my lack of concentration. I sometimes get distracted very easily and forget to do my work and the deadline we have for it. I think I need to work on that and make sure I stay focused on my work and the deadlines we have so we finish everything on time.

            I went to the career day and I thought it was really interesting. I learned a lot about different companies and what they do. I think it is really interesting what you can do after the study. I also looked at different professions I can do and I found front end development the most interesting. My preference was already front end or design but I went to both of them and I choose front end because this caught my attention more.<br> I think career days are good to see what you want to do in the future and of course for internship.

            We had a showcase for our project. I thought it was really fun to show our project to other students and coaches and we got a lot of good feedback on our project which we can use to improve our project. I also went to different projects and gave them feedback. I thought it was really interesting to see what other students made and how they did it. I think this is a good way to learn from each other and to get feedback on your project. I also learned a lot from the other projects and I think this will help me in the future.
