        </h3>
        <p>
            It actually happened quite naturally. My group and I just made everything individually. Looked at all the designs and took the best parts of them and put them together in a final design.

        <h3>
            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made a moodboard for our studio to choose what type of style we wanted to use. It's a collection of pictures that represent the style I wanted to use for our studio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made this moodboard to find out what kind of style we wanted to choose for our studio. I wanted it to be more like a calm, relaxing and professional style. <br>
            Creating a moodboard is an important step in the process of designing an interactive media product, because it helps collect and analyze visual inspiration. My group and I wanted to make an website for our studio so I made a visual design of how I wanted it to look like. This interactive discussion and decision-making process is similar to user-centered design: you discuss, respond, and adapt. I searched for images that were calm, relaxing, and had a clean, professional look.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To create the moodboard I wanted, I started by thinking about the style I wanted it to be and the feeling it gives you. I choose for calm, relaxing and professional. When I decided about the style I searched images on Pinterest and Google that matched this idea. I focused on soft colors, minimalistic designs and clean layouts. I looked for pictures that gave me a peaceful and calm feeling and used it for my moodboard. I added the pictures that for me gave that feeling and added it to my moodboard to create a clear visual direction.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We had 5 different moodboards since there are 5 people in our group. We all made a moodboard in our preferred style. We looked at all the moodboards and choose the syle we liked the most and made another moodboard out of this.<br><br> 
            Making the moodboard is part of learning outcome 1 because it helps with the first step of designing an interactive media product. The moodboard was interactive because we worked together as a group, looked at each other’s moodboards, and gave feedback to choose one style. We also used digital tools to find and show our visual ideas. The style we chose will be used later in the design of an interactive product like a website or app, where users will see a calm and professional look.

        <h3>
            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Together as a group, we created the final moodboard for our studio. This moodboard represents the visual identity and overall style we all agreed on after comparing our individual ideas and preferences.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We made this final moodboard to make sure we all had the same vision for the studio’s look and feel. By combining the best elements from each of our individual moodboards, we created one clear and consistent style. This helps guide our future design decisions and keeps everyone on the same page.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To help create the final moodboard, I first looked back at all the individual moodboards we made earlier. I used these to get inspiration and understand which elements worked well. Since we are a development studio, we wanted the final moodboard to reflect a more tech-focused style—modern, clean, and innovative. After that, I searched for new images on Pinterest that matched this tech aesthetic. I focused on visuals that had a modern and digital look, and selected the ones that best represented the feeling we were going for. I added these to the moodboard to help shape the final version.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The result is our final group moodboard. It clearly shows the style we want for our studio: modern, tech-inspired, and professional. It reflects who we are as a team and sets the tone for how our website and other visual designs will look like, and that we are more focused on the development part of media design.<br><br>

            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I scrolled through the fonts in Figma to find fonts that looked good and fit the style of tech/development. I looked for fonts that were clean and professional. I also looked for fonts that were easy to read and not too fancy. Everyone in the group did this and after we all voted on the best font.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           After we voted on the font we liked best, we all agreed that was going to be the font of our studio. It's a clear and professioan font so we didn't really need a second font.

            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I looked up on YouTube how Adobe After Effects worked and how to make a text animation. I looke at a few videos and then I tried to do it myself. It went pretty good. Then Louis told me to color the three words into the colors of our logo. So I found out myself how to do that and I did.

            I looked up on Google for good ideas to help refugees in the Netherlands, every idea I added to the sheet just like everyone from the group.

        <p>
           The results are the project we have now. We are going to make a web app for the refugees to learn Dutch and to learn about the Dutch culture. I think that's a pretty good way to help them since they only get one hour of Dutch lesson a week.

            on our second presentation of our studio we didn't use the logo yet but the coaches said they really liked the picture we had in the beginning of our presentation as logo, so I scrapped everything I made and started again with Illustrator to make new logos like that one.

            The feedback was that it wasn't visual enough and far too much text. We went to the location of our so maybe I could use pictures I made of the location to make it more visual. and I had to make a visual design of the idea we had.<br>

            I made a new poster design keeping the feedback I got in mind to make it more visual. I still wanted to make the poster Dutch because it was going to be a Dutch learning app we were going to make. After I made this poster in Figma I asked feedback again.<br>
            The feedback was that the pictures I put in the posteer weren't relevant to what we were making so I didn't have to put them in. The phone I had should be bigger because that's the main thing from our project. An app on the phone. The languages I put in could also be more visual with flags of the countries. And I had to put in way less text.

            I again made a new poster. The final one. The phone is in the central so it's clear that it'll be an app for on the phone. There were flags instead of the languages and I made clear you can learn Dutch from a lot of languages. I put the text we wanted to put on the poster in a QR-code so if people are interested they can scan it and read it themselves. I still kept the Dutch style by using tulips in the poster.

           The results are the poster you see above. I am really proud of it. I think it looks really good and it fits what we are trying to make.

            We used Trello to keep track of our tasks and what we had to do.

            How did we do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We made a Trello board and we put all our tasks on it. We also put the deadlines on it and we put the people who had to do it on it.

        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The results are that we kept track of our tasks and what we had to do. We also kept track of the deadlines and who had to do it. To be honest we only did this for creating the studio. As a group we prefer to communicate about stuff and not look at a deadline because this can give stress and we prefer to work in this way.

        <p>
            We visited the location of our project and we did interviews with the refugees and volunteers that were there.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We wanted to know what the refugees need more to learn Dutch and to learn about the Dutch culture. We also wanted to know what the volunteers do and how they work. And we wanted to look at the location to get a better insight of the location and the refugees.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did we do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We prepared an interview to do with both of them. I voice recorded it (with permission of course) so we can listen it back in case we missed something.

            I did research for app ideas we had for the refugees.
        </p>

            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to find out what app we were really going to use. I took 5 ideas off the brainstorming board and went looking online if there were any apps that were similar to the ideas we had. I looked at the reviews and what people liked and disliked about the app. I also looked at the design of the app and how it worked.

        <p>
            The reason I didn’t go to the art festival is because I had to pick up my sister from the hospital in Sittard because she got surgery and my parents couldn’t pick her up. And besides that, I prefer the development side and  “The art department” doesn’t really sound like development.

        <p>
            What I want to be in the future is probably a developer. But I found out I also liked creating posters and stuff, asking feedback on it and implementing the feedback on the poster to make it perfect. I normally didn’t really like creating stuff like that but making the poster for our project was really fun. So probably something between these two things.
