            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made a moodboard for our studio to choose what type of style we wanted to use. It's a collection of pictures that represent the style I wanted to use for our studio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made this moodboard to find out what kind of style we wanted to choose for our studio. I wanted it to be more like a calm, relaxing and professional style. <br>
            Creating a moodboard is an important step in the process of designing an interactive media product, because it helps collect and analyze visual inspiration. My group and I wanted to make an website for our studio so I made a visual design of how I wanted it to look like. This interactive discussion and decision-making process is similar to user-centered design: you discuss, respond, and adapt. I searched for images that were calm, relaxing, and had a clean, professional look.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To create the moodboard I wanted, I started by thinking about the style I wanted it to be and the feeling it gives you. I choose for calm, relaxing and professional. When I decided about the style I searched images on Pinterest and Google that matched this idea. I focused on soft colors, minimalistic designs and clean layouts. I looked for pictures that gave me a peaceful and calm feeling and used it for my moodboard. I added the pictures that for me gave that feeling and added it to my moodboard to create a clear visual direction.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We had 5 different moodboards since there are 5 people in our group. We all made a moodboard in our preferred style. We looked at all the moodboards and choose the syle we liked the most and made another moodboard out of this.<br><br> 
            Making the moodboard is part of learning outcome 1 because it helps with the first step of designing an interactive media product. The moodboard was interactive because we worked together as a group, looked at each other’s moodboards, and gave feedback to choose one style. We also used digital tools to find and show our visual ideas. The style we chose will be used later in the design of an interactive product like a website or app, where users will see a calm and professional look.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned that creating a moodboard is a great way to start the design process. It helps to visualize ideas and gives a clear direction for the design. I also learned that working together as a group and giving feedback is important to create a final product that everyone is happy with. This will help us in the next steps of the project because we now have a clear style to follow when designing our studio.

            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Together as a group, we created the final moodboard for our studio. This moodboard represents the visual identity and overall style we all agreed on after comparing our individual ideas and preferences.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We made this final moodboard to make sure we all had the same vision for the studio’s look and feel. By combining the best elements from each of our individual moodboards, we created one clear and consistent style. This helps guide our future design decisions and keeps everyone on the same page.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To help create the final moodboard, I first looked back at all the individual moodboards we made earlier. I used these to get inspiration and understand which elements worked well. Since we are a development studio, we wanted the final moodboard to reflect a more tech-focused style—modern, clean, and innovative. After that, I searched for new images on Pinterest that matched this tech aesthetic. I focused on visuals that had a modern and digital look, and selected the ones that best represented the feeling we were going for. I added these to the moodboard to help shape the final version.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The result is our final group moodboard. It clearly shows the style we want for our studio: modern, tech-inspired, and professional. It reflects who we are as a team and sets the tone for how our website and other visual designs will look like, and that we are more focused on the development part of media design.<br><br>
            The final moodboard is part of learning outcome 1 because it shows how we conceptualized and designed our studio’s identity. It is interactive because we all contributed to it, shared our ideas, and worked together to create a cohesive design. The moodboard will guide us in the next steps of designing our website and other media products, ensuring that we maintain a consistent style throughout our work.

        <p>
            I learned that collaboration is key when creating a cohesive design. By combining our individual ideas, we were able to create a stronger final product. This experience taught me the importance of communication and feedback in the design process. In the next steps, this will help us stay aligned and focused on our shared vision as we move forward with the project.

        <h3>
            What did we do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We researched a variety of fonts to find out which one would fit the style of the moodboard we made. Our goal was to choose a font that would fit with the calm, professional and tech-inspired style we created for our studio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did we do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We chose to look at different fonts because the typography is a very important role in setting a tone and feeling of our studio's identity. We really wanted a font that would fit our easthetic we created in our moodboard. A good font can strengthen the overall design.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I scrolled through the fonts in Figma to find fonts that looked good and fit the style of tech/development. I looked for fonts that were clean and professional. I also looked for fonts that were easy to read and not too fancy. Everyone in the group did this and after we all voted on the best font.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           After we voted on the font we liked best, we all agreed that was going to be the font of our studio. It's a clear and professioan font so we didn't really need a second font.<br>
           Font research is part of learning outcome 1 because it is an important step in the design process. It helps us choose a font that fits our studio's identity and the style we want to achieve. The process was interactive because we all contributed our ideas and preferences, and worked together to find a font that everyone liked. This will help us maintain a consistent look and feel in our designs, making sure everything aligns with our studio's vision.

        <p>
            I turned our slogan into a small animation to tell more about our studio. I made it so it works good with our style.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Me and my group had trouble choosing between the words "Create," "develop," and "Design" for our slogan, because each one represents a very important part of what we do. So insead of choosing just one, I made a small and subtle animation with all three words. This way, the animation highlights the full range of our work while keeping the message dynamic and engaging.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I started by watching a few youTube tutorials on how to learn the basics of Adobe After Effects since I had no clue how to use that. I wanted to learn simple text animations. After getting a general idea, I experimented with the tools myself and managed to animate the slogan. Later, Louis suggested that I could add our colors to the three words to mach our logo. I figured out how to apply this to only the switching words and updated the animation.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The result is the animated video on top of this text. It brings our slogan to life in a way that matches the overall style of the project. I am proud of how it turned out, especially since it was my first time working with Adobe After Effects.
           the slogan is part of learning outcome 1 because it is an important part of our studio's identity. It helps us communicate what we do and what we stand for. The animation is interactive because it adds a dynamic element to our design, making it more engaging for the audience. This will help us create a strong visual identity for our studio and make our work more memorable.

        <h3>
            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?

        <p>
           I learned the basics of Adobe After Effects, including how to animate text and apply custom colors or a gradient. The experience gave me more confidence in using animation tools. In further steps I will be able to create more advanced animation to make our designs more dynamic and engaging.

        <p>
            I found out that user testing is very important to improve the design and usability for the app. it helps to identify any issues or areas of improvement we didn't see before we started coding it. We use the feedback to make the necessary changes to our app before we start coding it. This will help us create a better app that meets the needs of our users and is more user-friendly.

            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I created a moodboard with portfolio designs that I found inspiring or visually appealing.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to help found out what visual style I wanted for my own portfolio. By collecting examples, I was able to find out what elements I liked and get a clearer sense of the look and feel I wanted to achieve.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
           I searched for styles I liked on Dribbble and Pinterest, and put them together in a moodboard. I numbered each design and added notes about what I liked and disliked about them. This helped me better understand my own preferences and make more focused design choices for my portfolio.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
           The result is the moodboard I created with the notes, which helped guide the visual direction of my portfolio.<br>
              The moodboard is part of learning outcome 1 because it shows how I conceptualized and designed my portfolio. It is interactive because I actively engaged with the designs, analyzing what worked and what didn't. This process will help me create a more cohesive and visually appealing portfolio that reflects my style and skills.

            What did I learn and how will it help us in the next steps?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I learned how to analyze design elements and understand my style. By creating a moodboard I was able to visualize my preferences and set a clear direction for my portfolio design. This will help me stay focused on maintaining a consistent style in the next steps and make informed decisions as I continue to refine and develop the portfolio.
